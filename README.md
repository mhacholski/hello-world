# hello-world
Just another repository 

Hi Humans, this is my introduction message to my project. This Hello World project will simply be an introduction to my entire GitHub profile. My journey in Computer Programming has been very new and exciting. My first step in my journey was to find a good tutor/mentor, someone to teach me. I can proudly say after 4 weeks of tutoring, I have found a fine tutor by the name of Drew. He's very skilled and very knowledagable about programming and he teaches me so much. I'm very grateful to have Drew as a tutor. I feel my next steps will include further online teaching, researching knowledge, and ultitlizing Github. So far I don't know how Github really works, but I'm looking forward to finding out. Thank you all so much for reading this! 9/17/2016.
